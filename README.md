# Internship Projects â€“ Python Code Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and tools developed throughout various internship experiences. The projects showcased here reflect hands-on work in areas such as machine learning, data analysis, algorithm design, and signal processing.

Each folder corresponds to a specific task or module completed during my internship journey, with clear documentation and modular structure to facilitate understanding and reuse.

Key highlights include:
- Implementation of supervised learning models
- Data preprocessing and visualization techniques
- Optimization routines and evaluation metrics
- Experimental workflows and prototype development

These tasks were completed as part of my professional training and academic development, and they demonstrate my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges.

Feel free to explore, fork, or reach out if you're interested in collaboration or feedback.
